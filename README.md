# OSDU Bicep

This project is used to host Bicep infrastructure that can be used in deploying OSDU on Azure.

## Project Principals

The guiding principal we have with this project is to focus on the the _downstream use_ of the project (see [releases](https://github.com/azure/osdu-bicep/releases)) The goal is to work on infrastructure in a manner that other components can consume infrastructure as code. As such, these are our specific practices.

1. Deploy all components through a single, modular, idempotent bicep template Converge on a single bicep template, which can easily be consumed
2. Provide best-practice defaults, then use parameters for flagging on additional options.
3. Minimize "manual" steps for ease of automation
4. Maintain quality through validation & CI/CD pipelines
